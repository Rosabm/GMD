My idea for the game is creating a mix of watergirl/fireboy and mario bros.
It would be a one player game set in a land where everybody has either 0 or 1 element, but the main character is for some reason born with the power of 2 elements and changing through them as he wants (as the game progresses he’ll discover he can actually use 4). This has won him the hate of the element king, who has sent his army to defeat him. Therefore, the game objective is to travel all through the land while fighting this army to get to the king's castle and defeat him first. The player can at any point change between fire/water. There will be obstacles and enemies, the player will be able to shoot fire/water balls to defeat the enemies. Some of the enemies will be defeated by both water and fire, but some will only be defeated by one of them, and after the game progress, you’ll find some enemies that will grow stronger when you hit them with the wrong element (for example a plant enemy that gets destroyed by fire, but gets bigger or faster with water). For the obstacles is the same story, there will be obstacles that kill water but do nothing to fire and the other way around, and some obstacles will kill both. The player will need to interact with the course objects to advance,and there will be for example some ice cubes that the player needs to jump on to get to a higher part of the course, but if he is using the fire character at the moment the cube will melt and they won't be able to continue and they will need to restart the game and try again. Because this can be a shame if they are near the end, there will be savepoints through the course. Some parts will involve more puzzle solving and thinking and others will be more focused on killing enemies. Similar to the mushrooms in mario bros, there will be items that allow the player to transform into a different element for an amount of time, for example air, which will give him the ability to fly and shoot gust of wind; and rock, which makes him immune to all the enemies (is not like the start in mario bros, because the enemies don't die, they just can’t harm the player).


Working title:
Super element bros.

Concept statement: 
A platform game in which the player can change between fire and water powers all through the game and can also get air and rock powers through items, which affects the way he interacts with the obstacles, objects and enemies which he has to face to complete the game.

Genre:
Platform game, with focus on challenge and aspects of fantasy and discovery.

Target audience: 
Could be played by people from all ages, probably most enjoyed by kids/teens.

Unique selling points:
The concept of changing the element of the player to be able to face different types of enemies and obstacles. Is a game for all of us who loved mario bros but hoped that it would involve some more thinking.

Player Experience and Game POV:
The player will be able to control this element changing guy, who I want them to care about and maybe have a favorite element in which to play. The course will be bringing new elements at all times (new enemies, new obstacles, new power ups…) which will make the player involved in the game and constantly thinking. The path will have increasing difficulty which will allow the player to test itself (at the beginning it won't matter too much if you are playing with fire or water but as the game progresses you will only be able to complete the course if you use each element at the correct time)

Visual and Audio STyle
The player won't be too complex, i would like it to be something in between fireboy and water girl characters and fall guys characters. The course will be something similar to the new super mario bros first level at the beginning, but it will go through different elements and therefore have fire, water, air and rock parts, which will influence the background (waterfalls for water, a volcano for fire, etc).

Game world fiction:
In this world, let's call it “element land”, each habitant has either 0 or 1 element. Each element is affected by others (water can kill fire, fire can kill earth, etc), but they have learned to cooperate with each other. That is until the player appears. For some reason, he is born with the power of 2 elements and the ability of changing through them as he wants (as the game progresses he’ll discover he can actually use 4). This has won him the hate of the element king, who has sent his army to defeat him. Therefore, the game objective is to travel all through the land while fighting this army to get to the king's castle and defeat him first, because only like that will he be able to be free.

Monetization
The game could be purchased like any normal game (imagine mario bros).

Platform, Technology and scope
First, the arcade machine at via. 2.5D (2d gameplay with 3d graphics). Unity. It will take the whole semester, and because it only counts with one long course and savepoints, it can be as short or as long as I have time to make it.

Objectives and Progression
As said before, it will be only one level with multiple save points. The player will be able to move just as in mario bros (left right jump and down) and additionally he will be able to move up (fly) when equipped with the air powers.

Interactivity
Just imagine an easy level of mario bros, almost the same, but the player will also be able to interact with objects in the course, like pushing/melting an ice block
