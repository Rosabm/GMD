# GMD
repository for the GMD course

At the end of the semester, this README should contain:

A link to a YouTube video demonstration of your game (~2min)
A list of links to all blog posts in your project (each blog post being its own markdown file in the repository)
Sources of any third party assets/code used (this includes any tutorials that you have followed)
Optionally, a link to a playable WebGL build of your game, hosted on GitHub Pages
